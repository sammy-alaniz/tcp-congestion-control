1. In order to run the mininet toplogy for the different delays and different algorithms, use the Python environment in the mininet VM.
    - Running 'python session.py' should gather all the data for plotting.

2. To plot the graphs,
    - First create a new python virtual environment with 'python3 -m venv venv'
    - Get into the virtual envrionment with 'source venv/bin/activate'
    - Then install dependencies with 'pip3 install -r plotting_requirements.txt'
    - Then run 'python3 data-parser.py'

3. All the graphs will be availble in the plots directory.

NOTE: The "plots" directory has data for the 2000 second run for congestion window data. The "plots-fairness" directory has data for the throughput data.
